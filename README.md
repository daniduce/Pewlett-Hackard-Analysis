# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis.

### The Purpose

  Pewlett Hackard management wanted Bobby and I to use our new found SQL skills to help the company determine how many employees per title will be retiring and apart of the "silver tsunami". Bobby's manager also wanted us to figure out how many employees are eligible for the mentorship program the company offers. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* Most of the employees retiring were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

* Throughout the analysis, we see that there are several employees that have been with the company in many different positions.

* The next generation employees that will be taking over and eligible to participate in the mentorship program were born January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

  As the "silver tsunami" starts to impact every day business, there are a lot of roles that will need to be filled. Looking at the Unique Titles chart, over 90K positions will need to be filled due to those heading in to retirement. 


### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

  While most departments will have enough staff to mentor the next generation, there are a few departments that will have trouble participating in the program. Due to a low number of employees in the Manager, Assistant Engineering and Technique Leaders departments, they will need to stratgetically plan out how they would like to mentor the incoming employees.
